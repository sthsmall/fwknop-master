This directory is used to collect information on which functions in the fwknop
sources are never called when the test suite is executed.  This assumes that
fwknop has been compiled with test coverage support like this:

$ CFLAGS="-O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" LDFLAGS="-fprofile-arcs" ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
$ make

Or, just do:

$ ./configure --enable-profile-coverage --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

Then the test suite can be executed with the --enable-profile-coverage-check
argument so that functions that are never called can be seen:

# ./test-fwknop.pl --enable-profile-coverage-check
