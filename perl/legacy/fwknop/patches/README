If you want to patch your OpenSSH client so that it can use fwknop directly
instead of having to use fwknop independently, then follow these instructions:

1.  Download the appropriate version of OpenSSH (i.e. one for which a patch
    exists, say, OpenSSH-4.3p2) and unpack it:

        $ cd ~/src
        $ tar xvfz openssh-4.3p2.tar.gz

2.  Put the patch file into the resulting OpenSSH sources directory and apply
    it:

        $ cp ~/src/fwknop-0.9.7/patches/openssh-4.3p2_SPA.patch openssh-4.3p2
        $ cd openssh-4.3p2
        $ patch -p1 < openssh-4.3p2_SPA.patch

3.  Run the configure script with the --with-spa-mode command line argument,
    and then compile and install:

        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-spa-mode && make
        $ su
        # make install
