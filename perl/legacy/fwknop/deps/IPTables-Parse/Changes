Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::Parse.

0.7 Fri Oct 17 11:55:01 2008
    - Completely re-worked the manner in which iptables commands are executed
      so that they are sent through a single function with various options
      (described below) for controlling execution.
    - Added the ability to control iptables execution model.  The default is to
      use waitpid(), but other options are to use system() or popen().
    - Added the ability to introduce a configurable time delay between each
      iptables command.
    - Added the ability to use a function reference for the SIGCHLD signal
      handler.

      timeout for iptables command execution in the waitpid() execution model.
