This directory contains perl modules and other dependencies used by fwknop.
These dependencies are included in this directory to ease the installation
process, but if fwknop is being installed on a system where all necessary
dependencies are already installed then it is recommended to install from one
of the fwknop "nodeps" tarballs or RPM's.  These distributions of fwknop do
not include any perl modules or other dependencies:
