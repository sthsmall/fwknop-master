Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::ChainMgr.

0.8 Fri Oct 17 11:35:15 2008
    - Added the ability to control iptables execution model.  The default is to
      use waitpid(), but other options are to use system() or popen().
    - Added the ability to introduce a configurable time delay between each
      iptables command.
    - Added the ability to use a function reference for the SIGCHLD signal
      handler.
    - Added the ability to configure the number of seconds used as the alarm
      timeout for iptables command execution in the waitpid() execution model.
    - Passed IPTables::ChainMgr option for execution model, configurable alarm
      timeouts, the SIGCHLD signal handler reference, and the configurable
      number of seconds for additional sleeps between iptables commands to the
      IPTables::Parse module.
    - Bugfix for SIGALRM handling to be more consistent with an example from
      the perlipc man page.
