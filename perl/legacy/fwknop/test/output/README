This directory is used by the fwknop test suite to store test output (both
stdout and stderr) from various tests against the fwknopd daemon and the
fwknop client.  The fwknop test suite creates a file in this directory that
begins with a test number prefix for the current test.

The files in this directory are useful for debugging purposes, and if there is
a problem running fwknop on a particular system then the information in this
directory along with the output of the test suite may provide a clue as to
why.  If fwknop appears to not be working properly and you want additional
help to diagnose the problem, you can tar up the output/ directory and send it
to Michael Rash at the following email address: mbr@cipherdyne.org.  NOTE:
the information in this directory is sensitive and contains the local firewall
policy, interface IP addresses, and more.  Before sending the output/
directory to anyone, you can use the --Prepare-results argument on the
fwknop_test.pl command line to automatically anonymize the test output
results.
