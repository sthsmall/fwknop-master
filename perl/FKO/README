FKO version 0.10
================

This module is essentially a Perl wrapper for the Firewall Knock
Operator library, "libfko".  See the "libfko" documentation for
additional information on the functionality provided by "libfko"
and usage overview.

INSTALLATION

The library "libfko" should already be installed on the local
system (in a location perl will find it) before attempting to
build/install this module.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

The Firewall Knock Operator library, "libfko".

For a CPAN version of this module it may be advantageous to uncomment the
Devel::Checklib lines in Makefile.PL, but this seems to introduce portability
issues on FreeBSD.
